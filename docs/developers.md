## Build

To build the software, follow these steps:

* Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* From Visual Studio Code, install the [platform.io](https://platformio.org/) extension.
* Open the `platform.io` folder to begin building the firmware.
* Once you've built the firmware, sign the resulting binaries with the `tools/radpro-sign.py` script: from a terminal, install the [requirements](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro/blob/main/docs/manual.md#radpro-tool), go to the `tools` folder and start the `radpro-sign.py` script. The signed `.bin` firmware files should appear in the `tools` folder.
* You can also build the software as a simulator by opening the project's root folder from Visual Studio Code. You'll need the [libsdl2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) and [libsercomm](https://github.com/ingeniamc/sercomm) library, which you can install using the [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html) package manager.

## Internal storage format

Data is stored internally using a compressed storage format. Integer values are represented in big-endian byte order.
