# Installing Rad Pro on the Bosean FS-5000

## Supplies

To install Rad Pro on your Bosean FS-5000 Geiger counter, you will need the following tools and components:

* An [ST-LINK V2 USB dongle (or clone)](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=st-link+v2)
* A 4-pin header
* A Philips screwdriver
* Optional: A soldering iron and solder
* If you use Windows, the [ST-LINK driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html)

## Step 1: Open the device

To start installing Rad Pro, turn off the device, remove the screws holding the back case and open the device.

The board should look like in the photo above. If it does not, you may have a different hardware revision. In this case, Rad Pro may not function properly.

If your board looks different and Rad Pro does not work, create an [issue](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro/issues).

## Step 2: Connect the programmer

Now, follow these steps:

* Optional: Solder the 4-pin header to the SWD pads of the board.
* If you use Windows, install the [ST-LINK driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html).
* Connect the ST-LINK V2 device to the SWD pads. The pins, from top to bottom, are:
  * +3.3V
  * SWDIO
  * SWCLK
  * GND

Make sure the electrical connections are correct. You may break your device if the connections are not correct.

## Step 3: Flash the firmware

Now, download the latest `radpro-flashtool` from the [Rad Pro releases](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro/releases).

* To install from Windows, go to the `bosean` folder, keep the ok/power button pressed during the flash process, and start `bosean-fs5000-[type].bat`.
* To install from macOS or Linux, go to the `bosean` folder, keep the ok/power button pressed during the flash process, and start `bosean-fs5000-[type].sh`.

`[type]` is the type of installation: `install` or `update` (note that not all releases support updating). For larger digits, you can also start the `landscape-install` or the `landscape-update` installation types.

The installation will automatically create a backup of the original firmware in the `backup` folder, so you can recover your device if something goes wrong. Make sure you keep the backups safe, so you can always return to the original firmware. To flash a backup, drag it onto `bosean-fs5000-install.bat` (Windows) or `bosean-fs5000-install.sh` (macOS/Linux).

Before closing the device, take note of the type of Geiger tube: the markings on the glass should be either J321, J305, M4011 or J614. If you have an unmarked tube measuring 55 or 65 mm long, you probably have a J614 or J613 tube, respectively.

Also take note of the type of LCD display: the marking on the ribbon cable should be "FPC1-H24C159-01W". If it is not, please create an [issue](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro/issues).

## Step 4: Configure your device

Start your device and go to Rad Pro's settings, select "Geiger tube", "Conversion factor", and select the option that matches the Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube installed in your device.

To establish a USB data connection under Windows, install the [CH340 driver](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=USB%5CVID_1A86%26PID_7523).

Last, read the [user's manual](../../manual.md) for learning how to use Rad Pro, and the [ionizing radiation field guide](../../field-guide.md) for learning more about ionizing radiation.

## Step 5: Get involved

If you like Rad Pro, consider watching the project to get notified when new releases are out. Also, show your support by starring the project on GitHub. And don't forget to read the keyboard mapping table below!

## Hardware-specific notes

On the FS-5000, the keys are mapped as follows:

  * Power on/off: long hold of the ok/power key.
  * Switch measurement mode: the down/settings keys.
  * Switch measurement secondary view: the up/back key.
  * Reset measurement/dismiss alarm: long hold of the up/back key.
  * Put display to sleep (measurement view only): the ok/power key.
  * Enter settings: short hold of the down/settings key.
  * Go up/down: the up/back and down/settings keys.
  * Select option: short hold of the right/settings key, or the ok/power key.
  * Go back: short hold of the up/back key.
  * Toggle pulses sound in measurement view: the up/back and down/settings key simultaneously.
  * Toggle lock mode: long hold of the ok/power and up/back keys.

To establish a USB data connection, connect your FS-5000 to a computer using a USB data cable.

<!-- Calculated as follows:

* With 1-byte differential values: [103 pages * (1 timestamp entry/page [16 bytes] + 2024 differential entries/page [1 byte each]) + page full indicator (2 bytes)] = 208575 entries
* With 2-byte differential values: [103 pages * (1 timestamp entry/page [16 bytes] + 1012 differential entries/page [2 byte each])] = 104339 entries

* 60-minute and 10-minute intervals require 2-byte differential values.
* 1-minute intervals and less require 1-byte differential values.

On the FS-5000, Rad Pro can store up to 208575 data points. At normal radiation levels (20 cpm), this allows for 4347 days of data at 60-minute intervals, 724 days at 10-minute intervals, 144 days at 1-minute intervals, 24 days at 10-second intervals and 57 hours at 1-second intervals.

The FS-5000 does not support HV profiles.
