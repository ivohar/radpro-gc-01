# Installing Rad Pro on Bosean FS-600/FS-1000 Geiger counters

This guide explains how to install the Rad Pro firmware on Bosean FS-600 and FS-1000 Geiger counters.

To update the firmware, use the [Rad Pro web installer](https://gissio.github.io/radpro-installer/).

## What you'll need

* **ST-LINK V2 USB dongle** (or compatible clone): Available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=st-link+v2).
* **4-pin header** for SWD connection.
* **Philips screwdriver** to open the device.
* **Optional:** Soldering iron and solder for a secure connection.
* **Windows users:** [ST-LINK driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html)

## Step 1: Open the device

1. Power off the device and remove the batteries.
2. Unscrew the back case and carefully open the device.
3. Confirm the circuit board matches the image above (Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube may vary). If it differs, you may have a different hardware revision, and Rad Pro may not work correctly. Report issues on the [Rad Pro GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro/issues).

## Step 2: Connect the programmer

1. Optional: Solder a 4-pin header to the SWD pads on the board for a reliable connection.
2. Connect the ST-LINK V2 to the SWD pads using this pin configuration (left to right):
  * 3.3V
  * SWDIO
  * SWCLK
  * GND

**WARNING:** Double-check connections to avoid damaging the device.

## Step 3: Flash the firmware

1. Windows users: install the [ST-LINK driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html).
2. Download and extract the latest `radpro-flashtool-[version].zip` from [Rad Pro releases](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro/releases).
3. Navigate to the `bosean-[device]` folder and run the appropriate script:
  * Windows: Double click `install.bat`.
  * Linux: Run `install.sh` in a terminal.
  * macOS: Open `Terminal.app` (in `/Applications/Utilities`), navigate to the `bosean-[device]` folder, and drag `install.sh` onto the Terminal icon in the dock.
  * `[device]`: `fss600` or `fs1000`.
4. Select a language by entering its two-letter code (e.g., `en` for English) when prompted.
5. The installer automatically backs up the original firmware to the `backup` folder. Store this file securely to restore the original firmware if needed.
   * To restore, drag the backup file onto `install.bat` (Windows) or `install.sh` (macOS/Linux).
6. Reassemble the device after flashing.

## Step 4: Configure the device

### FS-600 controls

  * **Power on/off:** Press and hold the OK/Power key.
  * **Switch measurement mode:** Use the Up or Down key.
  * **Switch secondary measurement view:** Press the Back key.
  * **Reset measurement/dismiss alarm:** Press and hold the Back key.
  * **Toggle pulse sound (measurement view only):** Press and hold the Down key.
  * **Sleep display (measurement view only):** Press the OK/Power key.
  * **Access settings:** Press the Right/Settings key.
  * **Navigate options:** Use the Up or Down key.
  * **Select option:** Press the Right/Settings or OK/Power key.
  * **Go back:** Prses the Back key.
  * **Toggle lock mode:** Press and hold both the Back and OK/Power keys.

### FS-1000 controls

  * **Power on/off:** Press and long hold the Set/Power key.
  * **Switch measurement mode:** Press the Mode key.
  * **Switch secondary measurement view:** Press the Set/Power key.
  * **Reset measurement/dismiss alarm:** Press and long hold the Mode key.
  * **Access settings:** Press and short hold the Set/Power key.
  * **Navigate options:** Use the Mode or Set/Power key.
  * **Select option:** Press and short hold the Set/Power key.
  * **Go back:** Press and short hold the Mode key.
  * **Toggle lock mode:** Press and long hold both the Set/Power and Mode keys.

### Configuration steps

1. Go to **Geiger tube > HV Profile** and select:
  * **Energy-saving:** Lowest power use, best for background radiation.
  * **Accuracy:** Higher power use, ideal for elevated radiation levels.
  * **Factory default:** Highest power use, matches original firmware settings.
2. For USB data connections on Windows, install the [CH340 driver](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=USB%5CVID_1A86%26PID_7523).

For detailed usage, see the [Rad Pro User Manual](../../manual.md) and the [ionizing radiation field guide](https://github.com/Gissio/ionizing-radiation-field-guide).

## Step 5: Support Rad Pro

If you find Rad Pro useful:

* Watch the [Rad Pro GitHub repository](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro) for release updates.
* Star the project to show your support.

## Hardware notes

* **Pulse LED:** Not supported on all devices.

* **USB data connection:** Requires a USB data cable for computer connectivity.

<!-- Calculated as follows:

* With 1-byte differential values: [42 pages * (1 timestamp entry/page [16 bytes] + 2024 differential entries/page [1 byte each])] = 85050 entries
* With 2-byte differential values: [42 pages * (1 timestamp entry/page [16 bytes] + 1012 differential entries/page [2 byte each])] = 42546 entries

* 60-minute and 10-minute intervals require 2-byte differential values.
* 1-minute intervals and less require 1-byte differential values.

 -->

* **Data storage:** Stores up to 85,050 data points. At 20 cpm (normal radiation levels), this supports:
  * 1772 days at 60-minute intervals
  * 295 days at 10-minute intervals
  * 59 days at 1-minute intervals
  * 9 days at 10-second intervals
  * 23 hours at 1-second intervals

* **Voltage limitation:** Two Zener diodes cap the high voltage at 440 V (nominal).

* **HV profile settings:**
  * Factory default: 40 kHz frequency, 50% duty cycle.
  * Accuracy: 2.5 kHz frequency, 6.5% duty cycle.
  * Energy-saving: 2.5 kHz frequency, 3.0% duty cycle.
