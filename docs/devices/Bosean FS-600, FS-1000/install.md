# Installing Rad Pro on Bosean FS-600/FS-1000 Geiger counters

This guide explains how to install the Rad Pro firmware on Bosean FS-600 and FS-1000 Geiger counters.

## Required supplies

To install Rad Pro, you'll need:

* [ST-LINK V2 USB dongle (or compatible clone)](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=st-link+v2)
* 4-pin header
* Philips screwdriver
* Optional: Soldering iron and solder
* For Windows users: [ST-LINK driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html)

## Step 1: Open the device

1. Power off the device and remove the batteries.
2. Unscrew the back case and carefully open the device.
3. Verify that the circuit board matches the image above (the Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube may vary). If the board differs, you may have a different hardware revision, and Rad Pro may not function correctly. If issues arise, report them on the [Rad Pro GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro/issues).

## Step 2: Connect the programmer

1. Optional: Solder a 4-pin header to the SWD pads on the board for a secure connection.
3. Connect the ST-LINK V2 to the SWD pads using the following pin configuration (left to right):
  * 3.3V
  * SWDIO
  * SWCLK
  * GND

**WARNING:** Double-check electrical connections to prevent damage to the device.

## Step 3: Flash the firmware

1. For Windows users, install the [ST-LINK driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html).
2. Download and extract the latest `radpro-[version].zip` from [Rad Pro releases](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro/releases).
3. Navigate to the `bosean` folder and run the appropriate script based on your operating system:
  * Windows: Double click `bosean-[device]-[type].bat`.
  * Linux: Run `bosean-[device]-[type].sh` in a terminal.
  * macOS: Open `Terminal.app` (in `/Applications/Utilities`), navigate to the `bosean` folder, and drag `bosean-[device]-[type].sh` onto the Terminal icon in the dock.
  * `[device]`: Type of device (`fss600` or `fs1000`).
  * `[type]`: Installation type (`install` or `update`). Note: Not all releases support updating.
4. The installer will prompt you to select a language using two-letter language codes. Enter the desired code to proceed.
5. The installer automatically backs up the original firmware to the `backup` folder. Store this securely to restore the original firmware if needed. To restore, drag the backup file onto `bosean-[device]-[type]-install.bat` (Windows) or `bosean-[device]-[type]-install.sh` (macOS/Linux).
6. Close and reassemble the device.

## Step 4: Configure the device

### FS-600 controls

  * **Power on/off:** Press and hold the OK/Power key.
  * **Switch measurement mode:** Use the Up or Down key.
  * **Switch secondary measurement view:** Press the Back key.
  * **Reset measurement/dismiss alarm:** Press and hold the Back key.
  * **Toggle pulse sound (measurement view only):** Press and hold the Down key.
  * **Sleep display (measurement view only):** Press the OK/Power key.
  * **Access settings:** Press the Right/Settings key.
  * **Navigate options:** Use the Up or Down key.
  * **Select option:** Press the Right/Settings or OK/Power key.
  * **Go back:** Prses the Back key.
  * **Toggle lock mode:** Press and hold both the OK/Power and Back keys.

### FS-1000 controls

  * **Power on/off:** Press and long hold the Set/Power key.
  * **Switch measurement mode:** Press the Mode key.
  * **Switch secondary measurement view:** Press the Set/Power key.
  * **Reset measurement/dismiss alarm:** Press and long hold the Mode key.
  * **Access settings:** Press and short hold the Set/Power key.
  * **Navigate options:** Use the Mode or Set/Power key.
  * **Select option:** Press and short hold the Set/Power key.
  * **Go back:** Press and short hold the Mode key.
  * **Toggle lock mode:** Press and long hold both the Set/Power and Mode keys.

### Configuration steps

1. In **Geiger tube > HV Profile**, choose an appropriate profile:
  * **Energy-saving:** Lowest power consumption, ideal for background radiation level.
  * **Accuracy:** Higher power consumption, suitable for elevated radiation levels.
  * **Factory default:** Highest power consumption, uses the original firmware profile.
2. For USB data connections under Windows, install the [CH340 driver](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=USB%5CVID_1A86%26PID_7523).

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [Rad Pro User Manual](../../manual.md) and the [ionizing radiation field guide](../../field-guide/field-guide.md).

## Step 5: Final steps

If you find Rad Pro useful, consider:

* Watching the [Rad Pro GitHub repository](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro) for release notifications.
* Starring the project to show your support.

## Hardware-specific notes

* **Pulse LED:** Not supported on all devices.

* **USB data connection:** Use a USB data cable to connect to a computer.

<!-- Calculated as follows:

* With 1-byte differential values: [43 pages * (1 timestamp entry/page [16 bytes] + 2024 differential entries/page [1 byte each])] = 87075 entries
* With 2-byte differential values: [43 pages * (1 timestamp entry/page [16 bytes] + 1012 differential entries/page [2 byte each])] = 43559 entries

* 60-minute and 10-minute intervals require 2-byte differential values.
* 1-minute intervals and less require 1-byte differential values.

 -->

* **Data storage:** Stores up to 89,100 data points. At 20 cpm (normal radiation levels), this supports:
  * 1814 days at 60-minute intervals
  * 302 days at 10-minute intervals
  * 60 days at 1-minute intervals
  * 10 days at 10-second intervals
  * 24 hours at 1-second intervals

* **Voltage limitation:** Two Zener diodes limit the maximum voltage to 440 V (nominal).

* **HV profile settings:**
  * Factory default: 40 kHz frequency, 50% duty cycle.
  * Accuracy: 2.5 kHz frequency, 6.5% duty cycle.
  * Energy-saving: 2.5 kHz frequency, 3.0% duty cycle.
