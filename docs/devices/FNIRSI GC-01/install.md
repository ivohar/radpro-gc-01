# Installing Rad Pro on FNIRSI GC-01/JOY-IT JT-RAD01 Geiger counters

This guide explains how to install the Rad Pro firmware on FNIRSI GC-01 and JOY-IT JT-RAD01 Geiger counters.

## What you'll need

To install Rad Pro, you'll need:

* **USB data cable:** Must support data transfer, not just charging.
* **Philips screwdriver** to open the device.

## Step 1: Open the device

1. Power off the device.
2. Unscrew the back case and carefully open the device.
3. Identify the microprocessor type (square chip), which should be CH32F103R8T6 (WCH) or APM32F103RBT6 (Geehy). **Warning:** Rad Pro is not compatible with devices using unmarked chips.
4. Identify the Geiger-Müller tube (marked on the glass as J305, J321, J613, J614, or M4011). For unmarked tubes:
   * 55 mm tubes: Assume J614.
   * 65 mm tubes: Assume J613.
5. Reassemble the device.

## Step 2: Flash the firmware

1. Download and extract the latest `radpro-fnirsi-gc01_[microprocessor]-[version].zip` from [Rad Pro releases](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro/releases).
2. Go to the `fnirsi-gci01_[micropreocessor]` folder, then to the  `install` subfolder. Choose the correct firmware file: `radpro-fnirsi-gc01_[microprocessor]-[language]-x.y.z-install.bin`.
   * `[microprocessor]`: `ch32f103r8t6` or `apm32f103rbt6`.
   * `[language]` Two-letter code for your preferred language (e.g., `en` for English).
3. Connect the device to a **Windows computer** using a **USB 2.0 port** and the USB data cable. **Warning:** Installation may fail on macOS, Linux, or USB 3.0 ports.
4. Power on the device. A USB drive should appear on your computer.
5. Copy the selected firmware file to the USB drive. The device should restart automatically, installing Rad Pro.

**Note:**

* Some devices require holding the **Power** button from power-on until the firmware is copied and the device restarts.
* Others may need the **Right/Settings** and **OK/Power** keys pressed together to make the USB drive available.

**Troubleshooting:**

* If the installation fails, press the **reset switch** next to the USB connector and repeat the process.
* To restore the original firmware, copy the [original firmware](firmware) to the USB drive.
* For persistent issues, follow the [FNIRSI GC-01 alternative installation instructions](install-stlink.md).

## Step 3: Configure the device

Use the following controls to operate your device:

  * **Power on/off:** Press and hold the OK/Power key.
  * **Switch measurement mode:** Use the Up or Down key.
  * **Switch secondary measurement view:** Press the Left/Back key.
  * **Reset measurement/dismiss alarm:** Press and hold the Left/Back key.
  * **Toggle pulse sound (measurement view only):** Press and hold the Down key.
  * **Sleep display (measurement view only):** Press the OK/Power key.
  * **Access settings:** Press the Right/Settings key.
  * **Navigate options:** Use the Up or Down key.
  * **Select option:** Press the OK/Power or Right/Settings key.
  * **Go back:** Press the Left/Back key.
  * **Toggle lock mode:** Press and hold both the Left/Back and OK/Power keys.

To configure the device:

1. Go to **Settings > Geiger tube > Sensitivity** and select the option that matches your Geiger-Müller tube.
2. Go to **Geiger tube > HV Profile** and select:
  * **Energy-saving:** Lowest power use, best for background radiation.
  * **Accuracy:** Higher power use, ideal for elevated radiation levels.
  * **Factory default:** Highest power use, matches original firmware settings.
3. If the device registers unintended key presses, select the **Energy-saving** HV profile or configure a custom HV profile to resolve the issue.

## Step 4: Support Rad Pro

If you find Rad Pro useful:

* Watch the [Rad Pro GitHub repository](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro) for release updates.
* Star the project to show your support.

## Hardware-specific notes

### FNIRSI GC-01/JOY-IT JT-RAD01 with CH32F103R8 (WCH) microprocessor

* Enable **Data Mode** in the settings to establish a USB data connection. Disable when not in use to save power.

* With 1-byte differential values: [5 pages * (1 timestamp entry/page [10 bytes] + 1012 differential entries/page [1 byte each])] = 5065 entries
* With 2-byte differential values: [5 pages * (1 timestamp entry/page [10 bytes] + 506 differential entries/page [2 byte each])] = 2535 entries

* 60-minute and 10-minute intervals require 2-byte differential values.
* 1-minute intervals and less require 1-byte differential values.
