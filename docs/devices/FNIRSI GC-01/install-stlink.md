# Installing Rad Pro on FNIRSI GC-01/JOY-IT JT-RAD01 Geiger counters with an ST-LINK

This guide explains how to install the Rad Pro firmware on an FNIRSI GC-01 or JOY-IT JT-RAD01 Geiger counter with a CH32F103R8T6 (WCH) or APM32F103RBT6 (Geehy) microprocessor. Use this method if:

* You cannot access the USB drive as described in the [regular installation instructions](install.md).
* Your device is unresponsive and requires recovery.

## What you'll need

* **ST-LINK V2 USB dongle** (or compatible clone): Available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=st-link+v2).
* **4-pin header** for SWD connection.
* **Philips screwdriver** to open the device.
* **Optional:** Soldering iron and solder for a secure connection.
* **Windows users:** [ST-LINK driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html)

## Step 1: Open the device

1. Power off the device.
2. Unscrew the back case and carefully open the device.
3. Identify the microprocessor type (square chip), which should be CH32F103R8T6 (WCH) or APM32F103RBT6 (Geehy). **Warning:** Rad Pro is not compatible with devices using unmarked chips.
4. Identify the Geiger-Müller tube (marked on the glass as J305, J321, J613, J614, or M4011). For unmarked tubes:
   * 55 mm tubes: Assume J614.
   * 65 mm tubes: Assume J613.
5. Reassemble the device.

## Step 2: Connect the programmer

Now, follow these steps:

1. Optional: Solder a 4-pin header to the JP1 pads on the board for a reliable connection.
2. Connect the ST-LINK V2 to the four pads next to the button cell battery.
  * If the pads are unlabeled (left to right):
    * 3.3V
    * SWDIO
    * SWCLK
    * GND

  * If the pads are labeled:
    * CLK → SWCLK
    * DIO → SWDIO
    * GND → GND
    * VCC → 3.3V

**WARNING:** Double-check connections to avoid damaging the device.

## Step 3: Flash the firmware

1. Windows users: install the [ST-LINK driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html).
2. Download and extract the latest `radpro-flashtool-[version].zip` from [Rad Pro releases](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro/releases).
3. Navigate to the `fnirsi-gc01_[microprocessor]` folder and run the appropriate script:
  * Windows: Double click `install.bat`.
  * Linux: Run `install.sh` in a terminal.
  * macOS: Open `Terminal.app` (in `/Applications/Utilities`), navigate to the `fnirsi-gc01_[microprocessor]` folder, and drag `install.sh` onto the Terminal icon in the dock.
  * `[microprocessor]`: `stm32f051c8`, `gd32f150c8`, or `gd32f103c8`.
4. Select a language by entering its two-letter code (e.g., `en` for English) when prompted.
5. If flashing fails, try powering the device via USB and repeat the process.
6. Reassemble the device after flashing.
7. Proceed to [step 3 of the regular installation instructions](install.md#step-3-configure-the-device).
