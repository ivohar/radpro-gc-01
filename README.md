
## Introduction

Rad Pro is an advanced custom firmware designed to enhance the functionality of various commercially available Geiger counters, including the [FS2011](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fs2011), [YT-203B](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yt203b), [Bosean FS-600](https://bosean.net/products/nuclear_radiation_detector.html), [Bosean FS-1000](https://bosean.net/products/FS-1000_nuclear_radiation_detector.html), [Bosean FS-5000](https://bosean.net/FS-5000-Nuclear-Radiation-Detector-2.html), [FNIRSI GC-01](https://www.fnirsi.com/products/gc-01) and [JOY-IT JT-RAD01](https://joy-it.net/products/JT-RAD01).

This fork more or less tracks the original [Gissio/radpro](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro), but is oriented to customizations for older FNIRSI GC-01 HW. Currently, it only addresses deficiencies of the display by adjusting color values of the existing themes.
