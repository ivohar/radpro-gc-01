
## Introduction

Rad Pro is a custom firmware that enhances the capabilities of several commercially available Geiger counters, including the [FS2011](docs/devices/FS2011/install.md), [YT-203B](docs/devices/FS2011/install.md), [Bosean FS-600](docs/devices/Bosean%20FS-600,%20FS-1000/install.md), [Bosean FS-1000](docs/devices/Bosean%20FS-600,%20FS-1000/install.md), [Bosean FS-5000](docs/devices/Bosean%20FS-5000/install.md), [FNIRSI GC-01](docs/devices/FNIRSI%20GC-01/install.md) and [JOY-IT JT-RAD01](https://joy-it.net/en/products/JT-RAD01).

This fork is more or less kept identical to the original [Gissio/radpro](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro), but it is oriented to customizations for older FNIRSI GC-01 HW.
